A basic Python Turtle controller using keyboard inputs (WASD keys).
This program allows the user to control a turtle object on the screen using the keyboard:

    W to move forward

    S to move backward

    A to turn left

    D to turn right
    It also includes a clear screen feature using the clear() method. Perfect for learning turtle graphics and basic event-driven programming!
